java-8 with AWS 
========================

This git repository contains support material for the [Java 8 Lambdas](http://tinyurl.com/java8lambdas) book.

Project Structure
-----------------

The overall code layout is:

* Code is in `src/main/java`
* Tests are in `src/test/java`

Within these directories things are organised by package:

* involve code in `com.insightfullogic.java8.exercises`
* Answers are in `com.insightfullogic.java8.answers` Coding questions are all in the form of failing tests, and the package-info.java

The sub-packages then correspond to the chapter number, so the examples for chapter 4 are in
 `com.insightfullogic.java8.examples.chapter4`.
